The beams here originate from Nicolas Fagnoni's simulations, found at:

https://github.com/Nicolas-Fagnoni/Simulations

These are power beams and the script `convert_to_healpix.py` was used to convert the directivity beams from the CST output to healpix (after unzipping the `.zip` files in `Radiation patterns/Directivity/` directory<sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>). This was done on 12 May, 2017, using Simulations git has 587e076. Only "East" polarization is available from the simulation, but "North" can be created by rotating ninety degrees because there is nothing in the simulation that would break the symmetry.

The beams are centered at theta = 0, and East at phi = 0 in healpix coordinate. An example script to read in the data and plot is provided, `example_beam_read.py`.

The script `convert_to_uvbeam` allows for converting E-field and power beam patterns from the original CST files to pyuvdata's UVBeam object and the beam FITS format. It also supports converting to HEALPix and limiting the frequency range of the beams read in. The script was used to generate a 100-200MHz HEALPix power beam file, `NF_HERA_power_beam_healpix.fits`, on 3 April 2018 (using the Simulations git hash 72bb3c3 and pyuvdata git hash 16a246a).

The files generated by this script follow the pyuvdata beamfits format (described here: https://github.com/HERA-Team/pyuvdata/blob/master/docs/references/beamfits_memo.pdf),
and can be read into pyuvdata's UVBeam object using the `UVBeam.read_fits` method.
